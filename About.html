        <p class="about-text">
            I'm Sariel Oliveira, a multidisciplinary professional with a background in film directing and a recent specialization in UI/UX design. My career has taken me through various creative roles—from audiovisual production assistant and art assistant to casting photographer and video editor.<br><br>
            Technology has always been a constant curiosity in my life. I'm fascinated by discovering, analyzing, and testing new innovations. That passion led me to dive into the world of UI/UX design, where I completed Google's UX Design course. I found that this field perfectly unites many of my personal interests: aesthetics, structure, logic, and the user experience.<br><br>
            I deeply value organization and functionality in everything I create. For me, great design is not only visually appealing but also intuitive and practical. I believe in finding harmony between beauty and usability—ensuring that every digital interaction feels seamless and natural for the user.
