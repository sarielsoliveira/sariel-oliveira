<!-- Texto Paper Wireframes -->
<p class="paperwire-text">
  I sketched out primary and secondary page wireframes.<br>
  Conceptualizing the entire app on paper helped streamline the transition to digital—both low- and high-fidelity prototypes, making the design process faster and more effective.<br><br>
  This approach allowed me to plan various layouts, structures, and user flows with greater clarity and precision.

<!-- Texto Low-Fidelity Prototype -->
<p class="lowfi-text">
  After sketching a preliminary layout on paper, I moved on to creating the initial digital designs for the Doa app.<br><br>
  These early designs focused on guiding users through the core functions on the home screen, clearly highlighting key features such as posting a product, favorites, user profile, and search—all represented through intuitive icons.

<!-- Texto Findings -->
<p class="findings-text">
  Based on the usability testing results, I applied several design changes to improve the overall user experience:<br><br>
  Repositioned the search bar to the top of the screen for greater visibility.<br><br>
  Removed the “search by category” option to streamline navigation.<br><br>
  Eliminated the introductory description of Doa from the homepage to reduce visual clutter and focus users on core actions.

<!-- Conclusions -->
<h3 class="conclusions-title">Conclusions:</h3>




<!-- Subtítulo Impact -->
<h4 class="impact-subtitle">Impact:</h4>












<!-- Texto Impact -->
<p class="impact-text">
  The application fosters sustainability by supporting both the environment and the community. 
  It encourages conscious consumption and empowers users to participate in a circular economy—
  helping one another through mindful sharing.<br><br>
  <em>A quote from peer feedback beautifully captures this spirit:</em><br>
  “I loved the idea. So often I want to get rid of clothes I no longer wear, 
  but I’d much rather know they’re going to someone who will actually use them.”
</p>







<!-- Subtítulo What I Learned -->
<h4 class="learned-subtitle">What I Learned:</h4>







<!-- Texto What I Learned -->
<p class="learned-text">
  A key takeaway from this project was the value of planning most of the design—including interactions 
  and color choices—by sketching on paper first. This approach gave me greater creative freedom and 
  allowed me to explore ideas more fluidly. As a result, the transition to both low- and high-fidelity 
  digital layouts became quicker and more structured.
